# Holidaze Accommodation Booking Application

![project-image](/src/Holidaze-exam.png)

## Description
Holidaze, my final exam, introduces a newly launched accommodation
booking site, that has tasked us with developing a modern front-end
application. This project has both customer-facing and admin-facing
sides, enabling users to book holidays and manage venues and bookings.

Users who are not registered can still browse and search for venues.
However, signing in is a prerequisite for booking venues.
Additionally, only users registered as venue managers have the
capability to create, update and delete their own venues.

### Goals
- Implement a user-friendly interface for venue booking.
- Provide a smooth administrative interface for venue management.

## Requirements
- Utilize the Holidaze API as mentioned in the Noroff API documentation.
- Follow specified user stories and technical restrictions.
