# Holidaze - Project Exam 2

![project-image](/src/Holidaze-exam.png)

## Description
Holidaze, my final exam, introduces a newly launched accommodation
booking site, that has tasked us with developing a modern front-end
application. This project has both customer-facing and admin-facing
sides, enabling users to book holidays and manage venues and bookings.

Users who are not registered can still browse and search for venues.
However, signing in is a prerequisite for booking venues.
Additionally, only users registered as venue managers have the
capability to create, update and delete their own venues.

## Build With
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - A library for styling React applications using tagged template literals
